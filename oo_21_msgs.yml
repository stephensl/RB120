  Here's how it works:

  In a game of 21, there are two participants: player and dealer.

  The objective is to create a hand that is closest to 21, without going over.

  1. Player Bets
    - Player places a bet for the current hand.

  2. Initial Deal
    - Each participant is dealt two cards.
    - Player is able to see only one of the dealer's cards.

  3. Review Hand
    - Player calculates point value of hand (sum of card values).
    - Card Values:
      - (2-10) => numeric value of card.
      - (Jack, Queen, King) => 10.
      - (Ace) => may be 11 or 1.

  4. Player Turn
    - Player may choose to:
      - 'hit' => receive another card, which is added to total.
      - 'stay' => keep current total and move to dealer turn.

      - if player decides to 'hit' and hand total is greater than 21,
        the player 'busts' and the dealer wins automatically.

  5. Dealer Turn
    - Dealer then chooses to hit or stay.
      - Dealer must 'hit' if total is less than 17.
      - Dealer 'stays' if total is 17 or higher.
      - If dealer 'busts', player wins.

  6. Compare Hands
    - If no player 'busts' and each has chosen to 'stay',
      - Hand totals are compared, and closest to 21 wins.

  7. Pay or Get Paid
    - If player wins, player collects payment equal to bet.
    - If player loses, player must surrender bet.
